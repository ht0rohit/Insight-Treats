# Insight-Treats

This is a WebApp based on the concept to work as a third party among college students to showcase their ongoing projects and gain
insights from others by sending a request to and interacting with other people on the basis of their projects, technologies used and their
experiences

• Make your project details visible or hidden to people or a particular person as per your convenience.

• Do you know too much but don't know where to implement it? Offer help to people having less knowledge but great ideas.

• Get relevant suggestions for people, simultaneously, with the help of machine learning.
